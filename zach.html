When Zach woke up, his parents and twin sister had been murdered and his house was destroyed. Falécia kidnapped Zach to be trained as a general in the castle she served at.</p>
        <p> At the castle, Zach was horribly abused, being starved and beaten into submission. He was placed as the leader of the Thirty Scouts. (30 children kidnapped similarly to Zach) Eventually, Zach befriended the 18th scout, Keira, when she helped him up after a fall.</p>
        <p>Zach was told by Them that Mattie was part of a prophecy that would destroy the earth. If Zach managed to work for seven years and fulfil the prophecy, his parents would be brought back.</p>
        <p>By the time Zach was ten, he managed to finally capture Mattie in a playground dimension. Mattie accidentally let out important information about her family and friends. Zach pretended to not care and "accidentally" let a portal open for her to escape.</p>
