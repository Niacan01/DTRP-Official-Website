        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>Nova was in line to be a princess of a faerie kingdom when she was kidnapped and sold to the Assassin's guild at a very young age.</p>
        <p>Nova had her wings binded to where she couldn't use them to escape the guild and was trained in medical combat.</p>
        <p>As a little kid she had a tendency to try and be nice to everyone, when she met Tess she wanted to be her friend but was eventually separated into the Medic Faction of the guild and started to develop a self-centered personality.</p>
        <p>When it came to being sorted into groups, Nova was put on Tess and Comet's team. She had not realized who Tess was and found her very annoying. They got in fights a lot early on because of this.</p>
        <p>Nova eventually began to like Tess after realizing who she was under her similar self-centered exterior. This caused Nova to develop feelings for Tess and for her to abandon her self-centeredness in turn for her original kind and caring personality.</p>
        <p>After a while, Nova and Tess ended up in a relationship despite it being strictly prohibited. </p>
        <p>Eventually, Nova, Tess, and Comet decided to attempt to escape the guild which ended with Comet being killed and Nova sacrificing herself to keep Tess alive.</p>
