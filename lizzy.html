</div>

<div id="description">
	<h2>Physical Description</h2>
		<p>In her shadow form, Lizzy has a thin frame with paper white skin and long white hair with black gradient highlights. She keeps her hair tied up into pig tails, eventually she traded this in for shorter hair once she started following Lily around on quests. She has large black eyes and a button nose. In her human form, she has similar features but is taller and has light blonde hair with soft blue eyes. </p>
	<h2>Personality</h2>
		<p>Lizzy is very cheerful, affectionate, and optimistic with a love for adventuring and protecting others. She can be very self-critical and a perfectionist at times. Several characters have also referred to Lizzy as being overbearing and stubborn. Besides her flaws, Lizzy is generally seen as being nice and trustworthy.</p>
</div>

<div id="backstory">
	<h2>Backstory</h2>
		<p>Lizzy was born in the 1930's to unnamed parents that left her in the care of her aunt and uncle. Lizzy grew up as a servant to her guardians and would work every minute she wasn't sleeping, any disobedience would land her getting severe punishments. The worst of these punishments was when she accidently dropped some food into the cooking fire and was forced to grab it out, resulting in a horrific burn that manifested itself as a scar on her right hand.</p> 
        <p>As Lizzy got older, her other aunt, Eilis and cousins would visit. It was clear that her guardians disliked this but they seemed almost afraid to tell the aunt no. Unfortunately, Eilis was set to move away to the city over the summer of 1942, which would leave Lizzy helpless again. Thankfully, Eilis snuck Lizzy out of the house without saying anything.</p>
		<p>Now free from being a servant, Lizzy was able to grow her talents and attend school. She was considered popular due to her singing talents and was asked to join the church's singing choir. Lizzy was unaware of the fact that this church was a cult.</p>
		<p>While at school, Lizzy became best friends with Helen and Ruthie. Lizzy had also talked to Ben several times but he always seemed to have something else to worry about.</p>
		<p>During the summer of 1944, Lizzy and her friends noticed that Ben and a few others from the school and church had gone missing, including Helen's mother. The church announced an event where groups of students would present an art project they had worked on, Lizzy and her friends used this as a way to sneak in to the blocked areas of the church to find the missing people. </p>
		<p>While their project was being presented by Helen, Lizzy and Ruby got the other students to follow them while they searched the church. Lizzy split off after hearing crying and went to the top floor while Ruby and the others went to the basement.</p>
		<p>At the top floor, Lizzy found a boarded up room and went to open it. Before she could, a knife lodged itself next to her head just barely missing it. The person who threw the knife was the pastor and he chased after her. Lizzy was able to spend a while dodging but eventually found a knife lodged into her leg, another straight to her heart followed and she went dark.</p>
		<p>Before the preacher could take her body, something stopped him from moving and Lizzy's body seemed to melt through the floor. She ended up in an endless "pool" of what looked like shadows for several decades before being woken up by the events of Error regaining his body.</p>

	<h2>Main Story</h2>
	<h3>In Shadow Connections</h3>
		<p>Eighty years after her imprisonment, Lizzy managed to escape the office and explore the ruins of the church. She suffered extreme amnesia and was unable to remember anything except her nickname. </p>
		<p>Lizzy eventually met Ben, another victim of the murders. They eventually joined together as a team and met Ruby. She took them both to the Rebuilt City where they met Lizzy's cousins who helped her regain several memories, including that she was a natural born witch</p>
	<h3>In DTRP</h3>
	    <p>Lizzy was first seen when Tess accidentally led the group into the shadow world with a travel crystal. Lizzy introduced the DTRP group to her friends and showed them around.</p>
		<p>They all went together on a short mission to retrieve some supplies but were cut short when Lizzy got possessed by a newly awakened Error. They managed to fight Error off and get Lizzy back but were warned that Error being back meant that something very bad was coming.</p>
		<p>The next time Lizzy ran into the group was at the School, there she started to take a liking towards Lily and started to become part of the DTRP group.</p>
