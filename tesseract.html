		<p>As she grew up, Tesseract has to deal with Eclipse's future visions leaking into her mind and with being able to hear her mothers thoughts. eventually, this led to Tess becoming unstable and creating a house fire which killed her parents and left Eclipse at the brink of death.</p>
		<p>The original plan was to take Eclipse with her after she started the fire, but it failed and she assumed Eclipse died. Tess tried to go back but was caught and taken to the Assassin's Guild</p>
		<p>After getting her memories altered, Tess was trained to be a ruthless assassin. She let go of her empathy and let anger lead, this resulted in her murdering several of the other assassins after being bullied by them.</p>
		<p>When Tess was around 12, she was assigned to her first squad with her teammates being Nova and Comet. They all became friends and caused Tess to gain back a few of her memories and some of her empathy.</p>

<div id="abilities">
	<h2>Abilities</h2>	
		<h3>Portal Creation</h3>
		<p>One of Tess's first shown powers was her portal creation ability, she can create portals to various locations and dimensions at any given point. She started off being weak with he ability, only being able to make around three a day. Eventually she got to the point she can make an unlimited number with minimal effort.</p>
        <p>Tess's portals are generally various shades of translucent blue, you can see faint images of what the other side is. Exceptions are portals to more hidden realms, such as the deity realm (white), or the writers portals. (All of which reflect their writer)</p>
		<p>Tess first learned the ability as a toddler, she would focus and be able to see weak point in space and time, she would then open and distort them making small portals for her to reach through. As she got older and started rebelling against the Assassins Guild, her portal abilities fully reawakened and she honed them.</p>

<div id="relationships">
	<h2>Relationships</h2>
		<h3>Mattie</h3>
		    <p>Tess first heard about Mattie as part of a prophecy, before leaving the Assassin's Guild, Tess was assigned to locate and capture Mattie. Due to having nowhere else to really go, she decided to go ahead and find out who Mattie was just for something to do.</p>
			<p>After having officially met Mattie in the forest, Tess gave up on using the mission as a bounty due to Mattie reminding Tess of someone she once cared about. (This ended up being Eclipse)</p>
			<p>During the backrooms arc, Mattie showed concern for Tess when she fell unconscious due to using her abilities too much.</p>
        <h3>Velocijammer</h3>
		<p><em>"I'm sorry Vel..."</em></p>
		    <p>Tess was first concerned about the fact he would have been the type of anomaly she would have had to neutralize if she were still an assassin, but she quickly grew attached to him.</p>
			<p>Eventually both of them became really good friends, and both cared about each other a good amount. Unfortunately, Tess started to become overprotective due to her previous trauma with Nova and Comet's deaths.</p>
			<p>Tess's overprotective side ended up being her downfall as both of them would become frustrated with each other, Tess being mad as Velocijammer seeming to not care about his life, and Velocijammer being mad at Tess for trying to control him. This led to both of them getting in a really bad fight where Velocijammer ended up leaving.</p>
