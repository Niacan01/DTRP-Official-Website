        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>Ruby was born in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. Being born as the second child of a marked one, Ruby was doomed to die in infancy. Her father, having known several witches in the area, managed to keep Ruby alive long enough to survive the curse and be able to live a mostly normal life.</p>
        <p>Due to growing up in the middle of a deep forest in Appalachia, Ruby would spend almost every day playing outside and swimming in the nearby river. By the age of three, Ruby managed to learn to hunt, fish, and help her father gather herbs.</p>
        <p>At the age of six, Ruby's family moved to New York after a fire burned down their house. Her father managed to become a successful and popular writer in New York and their family was wealthy.</p>
        <p>During the summer of 1939, Ruby's family was out for a drive. Unfortunately, someone has tampered with their car and it blew up while they were in it. Everyone survived, but Ruby was dragged off by someone while unconscious.</p>
        <p>When Ruby woke up, she found herself in an orphanage with no memories of her past. The staff only knew her name due to it being written on the tag of her dress.</p>
