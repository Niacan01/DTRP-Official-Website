    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The Deities are an ethereal race born from an angel and a demon. They are extremely powerful and reside in the Inbetween where they observe the stars and galaxies.</p>
</div>

<div id="description">
    <h2>Physical Description</h2>
        <p>While Individual traits differ between the bloodlines, there are several main features each one has:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extremely thick and near indestructible hair with bold colors and contrasting highlights, all of which are natural to them.</li>
                <li>A distant look, their faces don't show emotion. Their eyes always look blank and uncaring.</li>
                <li>Large wings in a similar color to their eyes. These wings are translucent and nearly indestructible.</li>
            </ul>
</div>

<div id="habitat">
    <h2>Habitat and Location</h2>
        <p>The deities all live in a place known to some as the "Inbetween." The Inbetween is a cloud like dimension that can be found among the Islands.</p>
        <p>The Inbetween have one main island, about the size of Texas. That is where all of the deities live. Outside of their main island are several smaller islands where fairies come from.</p>
</div>

<div id="behavior">
    <h2>Behavior</h2>
        <p>The deities spend most of their time observing space, they are able to change and shape the way universes are formed based on their bloodline.</p>
        <p>While they could live forever, they have established a ceremony that they partake in every one million years. The ceremony involves the deity who has reached that age to go to a sacred platform where they will cast themselves into fire to be reborn. An infant is left behind and the rest of their matter becomes some form of heavenly body.</p>
        <p>The deities hate any species that isn't their own, fairies are the only exception. This hatred was described as a sickness by Asteri and Tess.</p>
        <p>Every thousand or so years for younger deities, they will go to a mortal planet and find a mortal to trick. This mortal will see them as being their soul mate. Once the deity manages to have a child, they will burn down the home of the mortal and kill everyone near it. This hybrid child is brought back to the Inbetween, and will be trained in the art of reality distortion and teleportation. Once they have been trained enough, they are leaded off to be killed in a ceremony involving fire. Once the ceremony is over, a crystal is left in the place of the child. This are what become the dimension crystals.</p>

<div id="diet">
    <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>Deities have no need to eat, but they have a hatred for human food. If they wanted to eat, they would eat clouds and star dust.</p>
</div>

<div id="culture">
    <h2>Culture/Cultural Significance</h2>
        <p>The deities have a culture based on a form of unity. While they do not have a hive mind, they all tend to agree with each other and there are no conflicts between them.</p>
