    <div id="backstory">
        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>Nicholas was born to Aethel and Lorelei. Lorelei passed away after Nicholas was born and Aethel eventually left to find something to take down his older brother, Lucius. </p>
        <p>Lucius abused Nicholas for about a decade with Aethel occasionally popping in. Eventually Aethel took down his brother and took over as All Seer, freeing the cities from his brother's reign of terror. </p>
        <p>With his father back, Nicholas was able to grow up safely and later become All Seer. He made and lost a lot of friends including his adoptive daughter.</p>
